2. **Manual Build:**<br>
   Detailed instructions will be provided soon. In the meantime, follow the steps below to build from source:
    - Prospect relies on [profanity2]. Build the binary from the profanity2 repository and move the binary and OpenCL files to the `/bin` directory.
    - Update `src/lib.py` with the path to your `profanity2` binary.
    - Install Python dependencies with the following command:
      ```bash
      python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Start the UI:
      ```bash
      python3 src/main.py
      ```
